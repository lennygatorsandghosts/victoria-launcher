 * 2. The private space, if it has anything at all in it: the padlock first, then its apps.
 * 3. The launcher's own rows.
 *

 * letter are ordered by how often they were opened from here. The letters themselves never
 * move — an app is still filed under its own name, or the scrubber would be pointing at
 * nothing. The two tail sections are never ordered by launch count: one is a padlock and a
