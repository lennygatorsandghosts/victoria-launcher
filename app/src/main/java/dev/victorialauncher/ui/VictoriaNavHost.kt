 * SAF stream into one String before anything downstream gets a chance to say no, which is an
 * easy way for a large-enough file to run the app out of memory before import validation ever
 * starts. This is the only place that needs to be bounded like this: the parser it feeds,
 * [dev.victorialauncher.data.parseSettingsExport], checks the same cap again on the resulting
 * String as a backstop for any other caller.
 *
 * The byte cap only ever fires once enough bytes have actually arrived -- a SAF provider that
 * neither writes to the pipe nor closes it leaves [InputStream.read] blocked with nothing to
 * time out on its own. Nothing in this function can do anything about that; see
 * [readBoundedUtf8WithTimeout] for how the caller bounds it from outside instead. Not
 * `private`: a JVM test exercises this directly against a stream that never yields a byte.

 * Runs [readBoundedUtf8] against [stream], but doesn't wait on it forever: once [timeoutMs]
 * elapses with no result, this closes [stream] out from under whatever is still blocked inside
 * [InputStream.read] and treats the import as failed.
 *
 * Closing the stream, not cancelling a coroutine, is what actually unblocks a stalled SAF
 * read: such a stream is typically backed by a pipe the content provider writes into, and a
 * blocking read on a pipe sits inside a native call that neither structured-concurrency
 * cancellation nor `Thread.interrupt()` reaches -- an earlier version of this function relied
 * on `runInterruptible` for exactly that and it never fired, because interrupting the waiting
 * coroutine does nothing to the read that is actually blocked. Closing the underlying file
 * descriptor does reach it. So the read runs as its own coroutine on [Dispatchers.IO], left
 * running if the timeout elapses first; this function then closes [stream] and waits for that
 * coroutine to actually finish -- which it now will, one way or another -- before returning,
 * so the stream is never left mid-read when this function hands control back. A read that
 * fails because the stream was closed out from under it is the expected shape of a timeout,
 * not a new error, so it's treated the same as any other failed or oversize read: null.
 *
 * Always closes [stream] itself on every path, including a normal read that finishes in time,
 * so the caller doesn't need its own `use {}` around it.
