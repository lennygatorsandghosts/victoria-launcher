// are the settings whose contents are app keys — which is this file's whole subject, and only
// incidentally the store's. Written out in both places they could drift apart with every test
// still green, and the drift would silently put the private space back into the backups.

/**
 * Strips [privateSerial]'s keys out of one stored preference's value, given the DataStore name
 * that names its shape. [privateSerial] is null or zero when there is no private space, which
 * strips nothing.
 *
 * Returns the value to export, or null when the whole entry should be dropped rather than kept
 * empty — a quick-launch slot pointed at a private app has nothing left to point at once that
 * app is gone from the backup. Every other shape stays present even when everything is stripped
 * out of it: an all-private favorites list exports as an empty one, and a folder every one of
 * whose members was private stays a folder, just an empty one, because the folder itself (its
 * name, its icon) is the user's, not a secret.
 *
 * A preference name this doesn't recognize, and a value with nothing of [privateSerial]'s in it,
 * comes back as exactly the object it was handed — never a rebuilt copy — so an export with no
 * private space touched is byte-for-byte what it always was.
