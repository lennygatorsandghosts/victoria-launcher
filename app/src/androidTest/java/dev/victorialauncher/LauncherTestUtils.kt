     * the right edge (inside the strip regardless of its configured width) and drags most of
     * the way across, which satisfies both a tap-and-release open and a full scrub drag.
     *
     * The y position matters as much as x: Android's own edge-gesture (back) claims the

     * (`View.setSystemGestureExclusionRects`) around the vertical center of the scrub band —
     * not the full screen height. A touch-down outside that reclaimed strip goes to the
     * system's back gesture instead of the app, so this works down a short list of heights
     * rather than one, starting with the middle of the screen where the strip sits for a home
     * screen with nothing on it.

     * Even inside the right strip, the very first swipe right after HOME can race the system:
     * it takes a moment after `setSystemGestureExclusionRects` is called for the window manager
     * to actually start honoring it, and there's nothing observable to wait on for that — so
     * this retries the swipe, checking each time for the app list's own search-field
     * placeholder, rather than guessing a fixed delay.
