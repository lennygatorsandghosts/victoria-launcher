/**
 * What a private space has to do, seen the way its owner sees it: from outside the app, on a
 * device where one exists.
 *
 * The app whose name is looked for has to be inside the private space and nowhere else, or a
 * row bearing that name says nothing about which profile it came from — so the set-up takes it
 * away from the main profile for the duration and gives it back afterwards.
 *
 * A device without a private space cannot answer any of this, so these skip rather than fail
 * there. Both the space and that app being in it are set up outside the test; see the
 * project's notes on preparing an emulator.
